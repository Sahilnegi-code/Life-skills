### Question 1
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
*Beginning small with tiny habits is a better plan of action than attempting huge changes all at once. Habits consist of three components: the routine (what you do), the reward (what you get), and the cue (what triggers it). Making even a minor change to one of these will make it easier to create healthy behaviors. It is effective at forming habits.

### Question 2
## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

*According to BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits Method" video, behavior equals motivation, ability, and promptness, or B = MAP. Should I start a new regimen, such as working exercise. Here's a small tip: Consider B = MAP. 'B' describes how I behave, such as when I exercise. Motivation is the letter "M": why do I want to exercise? The more clear my reasoning, the better. "A" stands for ability; keep it simple, similar to a brief workout. And finally, 'P' stands for prompt. Set a reminder or associate it with an existing habit, such as working exercise after brushing my teeth. Creating new habits is significantly easier when you follow B = MAP.*

### Question 3
## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

*Rewarding yourself for completing a habit is important since it strengthens the behavior in your mind. If something makes you happy, you are more likely to continue with it. According to BJ Fogg, appreciating small victories becomes a habit. Adding a positive experience helps a habit stick by signalling to your brain, "Hey, this is good!" after executing the behavior.*


### Question 4
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

*The concept of enhancing whatever you do by just 1% is the most appealing here. It's similar to how a cycling team improved tremendously after making countless minor changes. This highlights how small processes and improvements over time can add up to something genuinely important. The lesson here is to never underestimate the importance of small, steady stepsâ€”they can lead to enormous success!*


### Question 5
## What is the book's perspective about Identity?

*"Atomic Habits" says that if you want positive habits to last, become someone who exemplifies such actions. Making routines a part of your identity is more significant than simply completing your objectives. Gradual changes accumulate over time, so focus on maintaining consistency and forming a positive identity around your habits.

### Question 6
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
*To simplify habits, the book "Atomic Habits" suggests categorizing them into four stages: cue, yearning, response, and reward. It lays a major emphasis on creating an environment that makes routines desirable, satisfying desires right away, and making them simple to start and maintain. Simplifying and making habits enjoyable is the goal here, as it increases the likelihood of effective and consistent habit formation.*



### Question 7
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

*While the book "Atomic Habits" does not specifically address making bad habits harder, it does suggest focusing on creating settings that make bad habits more difficult and good habits easier. For example, if you want to stop chewing, you can keep dangerous foods out of reach. The idea is to create an environment that encourages positive behaviors while making undesirable ones more difficult.*

### Question 8:
## Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

**Habit: Regular Coding Practice**

   * Cue (When to Start): * Set a daily coding time. * Make sure the coding environment is ready and easily accessible.

    * Attractiveness (Make it Fun): * Focus on coding projects that correspond with personal interests.
        *Experience new technologies or languages that pique your interest.
        

    * Start with short coding sessions to avoid becoming overwhelmed.
        *Divide coding jobs into digestible sections or minor projects.

    * Satisfaction (Feel Good About It): * Recognize modest coding accomplishments, such as problem solving.


### Question 9:
## Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

**Preferring Nutritious Snacks Over Unhealthy Options**

    *Invisibility (Hide the Cue): *Remove unhealthy snacks from visible spots in the house.
    
    To avoid unappealing snacks, educate yourself on the nutritional benefits of better alternatives.
       
    *Difficulty (Make it Hard): *Plan and prepare nutritious foods ahead of time.
